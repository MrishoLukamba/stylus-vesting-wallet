= Access Control

Access control—that is, "who is allowed to do this thing"—is incredibly important in the world of smart contracts. The access control of your contract may govern who can mint tokens, vote on proposals, freeze transfers, and many other things. It is therefore *critical* to understand how you implement it, lest someone else https://blog.openzeppelin.com/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7[steals your whole system].

== Ownership and `Ownable`

The most common and basic form of access control is the concept of _ownership_: there's an account that is the `owner` of a contract and can do administrative tasks on it. This approach is perfectly reasonable for contracts that have a single administrative user.

OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus provides https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/latest/openzeppelin_stylus/access/ownable/struct.Ownable.html[`Ownable`] for implementing ownership in your contracts.

```rust
use openzeppelin_stylus::access::ownable::Ownable;

sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    struct OwnableExample {
        #[borrow]
        Ownable ownable;
    }
}

#[external]
#[inherit(Ownable)]
impl MyContract {
    fn normal_thing(&self) {
        // anyone can call this normal_thing()
    }

    pub fn special_thing(
        &mut self,
    ) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        self.ownable.only_owner()?;

        // only the owner can call special_thing()!

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

At deployment, the https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/latest/openzeppelin_stylus/access/ownable/struct.Ownable.html#method.owner[`owner`] of an `Ownable` contract is set to the provided `initial_owner` parameter.

Ownable also lets you:

* https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/latest/openzeppelin_stylus/access/ownable/struct.Ownable.html#method.transfer_ownership[`transfer_ownership`] from the owner account to a new one, and
* https://docs.rs/openzeppelin-stylus/latest/openzeppelin_stylus/access/ownable/struct.Ownable.html#method.renounce_ownership[`renounce_ownership`] for the owner to relinquish this administrative privilege, a common pattern after an initial stage with centralized administration is over.

WARNING: Removing the owner altogether will mean that administrative tasks that are protected by `only_owner` will no longer be callable!

Note that *a contract can also be the owner of another one*! This opens the door to using, for example, a https://gnosis-safe.io[Gnosis Safe], an https://aragon.org[Aragon DAO], or a totally custom contract that _you_ create.

In this way, you can use _composability_ to add additional layers of access control complexity to your contracts. Instead of having a single regular Ethereum account (Externally Owned Account, or EOA) as the owner, you could use a 2-of-3 multisig run by your project leads, for example. Prominent projects in the space, such as https://makerdao.com[MakerDAO], use systems similar to this one.
