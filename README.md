# OpenZeppelin Contracts for Stylus

**A library for secure smart contract development** written in Rust for
[Arbitrum Stylus](https://docs.arbitrum.io/stylus/stylus-gentle-introduction).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in a very early and experimental phase. It has never
> been audited nor thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities. Do not use
> in production.

## Features

- Security-first smart contracts, ported from the [`openzeppelin-contracts`]
  library.
- First-class `no_std` support.
- Solidity constructors powered by [`koba`].
- [Unit] and [integration] test affordances, used in our own tests.

[`openzeppelin-contracts`]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

[`koba`]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/koba

[Unit]: ./lib/motsu/README.md

[integration]: ./lib/e2e/README.md

## Usage

You can import OpenZeppelin Contracts from crates.io by adding the following
line to your `Cargo.toml` (We recommend pinning to a specific version):

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-stylus = "0.1.0-rc"
```

Optionally, you can specify a git dependency if you want to have the latest
changes from the `main` branch:

```toml
[dependencies]
openzeppelin-stylus = { git = "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/rust-contracts-stylus" }
```

Once defined as a dependency, use one of our pre-defined implementations by
importing them:

```rust
use openzeppelin_stylus::token::erc20::Erc20;

sol_storage! {
    #[entrypoint]
    struct Erc20Example {
        #[borrow]
        Erc20 erc20;
    }
}

#[external]
#[inherit(Erc20)]
impl Erc20Example {}
```

[examples](./examples).

[basic] example.
