//! Shims that mock common host imports in Stylus `wasm` programs.
//!
//! Most of the documentation is taken from the [Stylus source].
//!
//! We allow unsafe here because safety is guaranteed by the Stylus team.
//!
//! [Stylus source]: https://github.com/OffchainLabs/stylus/blob/484efac4f56fb70f96d4890748b8ec2543d88acd/arbitrator/wasm-libraries/user-host-trait/src/lib.rs
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! Without these shims we can't currently run unit tests for stylus contracts,
//! since the symbols the compiled binaries expect to find are not there.
//!
//! If you run `cargo test` on a fresh Stylus project, it will error with:
//!
//! ```terminal
//! dyld[97792]: missing symbol called
//! ```
//!
//! This crate is a temporary solution until the Stylus team provides us with a
//! different and more stable mechanism for unit-testing our contracts.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Import these shims in your test modules as `motsu::prelude::*` to populate
//! the namespace with the appropriate symbols.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[cfg(test)]
//! mod tests {
//!     use contracts::token::erc20::Erc20;
//!
//!     #[motsu::test]
//!     fn reads_balance(contract: Erc20) {
//!         let balance = contract.balance_of(Address::ZERO); // Access storage.
//!         assert_eq!(balance, U256::ZERO);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that for proper usage, tests should have exclusive access to storage,
//! since they run in parallel, which may cause undesired results.
//!
//! One solution is to wrap tests with a function that acquires a global mutex:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use std::sync::{Mutex, MutexGuard};
//!
//! use motsu::prelude::reset_storage;
//!
//! pub static STORAGE_MUTEX: Mutex<()> = Mutex::new(());
//!
//! pub fn acquire_storage() -> MutexGuard<'static, ()> {
//!     STORAGE_MUTEX.lock().unwrap()
//! }
//!
//! pub fn with_context<C: Default>(closure: impl FnOnce(&mut C)) {
//!     let _lock = acquire_storage();
//!     let mut contract = C::default();
//!     closure(&mut contract);
//!     reset_storage();
//! }
//!
//! #[motsu::test]
//! fn reads_balance() {
//!     let balance = token.balance_of(Address::ZERO);
//!     assert_eq!(balance, U256::ZERO);
//! }
//! ```
