# WAVM Shims

Shims crate that mocks common host imports in Stylus `wasm` programs.

## Motivation

Without this crate we can't currently run unit tests for stylus contracts,
since the symbols the compiled binaries expect to find are not there.

If you run `cargo test` on a fresh Stylus project, it will error with:

    dyld[97792]: missing symbol called

This crate is a temporary solution until the Stylus team provides us with a
different and more stable mechanism for unit-testing our contracts.

## Usage

Import this crate in your test modules as `wavm_shims::*` to populate the
namespace with the appropriate symbols.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use wavm_shims::*;

    #[test]
    fn reads_balance() {
        let token = init_token(); // Init an ERC-20, for example.
        let balance = token.balance_of(Address::ZERO); // Access storage.
        assert_eq!(balance, U256::ZERO);
    }
}
```

Note that for proper usage, tests should have exclusive access to storage,
since they run in parallel, which may cause undesired results.

One solution is to wrap tests with a function that acquires a global mutex:

```rust
use std::sync::{Mutex, MutexGuard};

pub use wavm_shims::*;

pub static STORAGE_MUTEX: Mutex<()> = Mutex::new(());

pub fn acquire_storage() -> MutexGuard<'static, ()> {
    STORAGE_MUTEX.lock().unwrap()
}

pub fn with_storage<C: Default>(closure: impl FnOnce(&mut C)) {
    let _lock = acquire_storage();
    let mut contract = C::default();
    closure(&mut contract);
    reset_storage();
}

#[test]
fn reads_balance() {
    test_utils::with_storage::<ERC20>(|token| {
        let balance = token.balance_of(Address::ZERO);
        assert_eq!(balance, U256::ZERO);
    })
}
```

### Notice

We maintain this crate on a best-effort basis. We use it extensively on our own
tests, so we will add here any symbols we may need. However, since we expect
this to be a temporary solution, don't expect us to address all requests.

That being said, please do open an issue to start a discussion, keeping in mind
our [code of conduct] and [contribution guidelines].
